# Soen 471 Project

# Abstract
One of the challenges in streaming services is to suggest movies to a user based on their interests, ratings, and metadata. A research from a website called Kaggle has shown that there are various ways to build a recommended movie system based on the relation of a user, their ratings, and the metadata of each movie itself. The goal of this project is to study and implement a movie recommendation system based on the data analysis algorithms studied in the course such as Recommender systems, and possibly Supervised learning and/or clustering. The dataset that will be used is the following: [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv). This dataset contains metadata on over 45,000 movies and 26 milion ratings over 270,000 users. More specifically, we will be analyzing the following .csv files: movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv. We want to analyze the relations between a user's ratings on a specific movie, the average rating of a movie, the genre of a movie, and its overview (plot). Based on this data, we will build a recommender system.
